  Hi! I´m Lewend.

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I'm currently a Post-Doctoral Fellow in Behavioral Economics at [JEDI lab](http://jedilab.weebly.com/) at Linköping University in Sweden :sweden: and an Associate Professor in Organizational Behavior at Oslo Business School (OsloMet) in Oslo, Norway :norway:.

I completed my PhD in Leadership and Organisation at BI Norwegian Business School in 2023, supervised by Professor Thorvald Hærem and Associate Professor Erik Løhre. My dissertation examined the role of emotions and psychological distance in decision-making under risk and uncertainty. During my PhD, I was also a visiting scholar at New York University, with [Trope Lab](https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/tropelab//).

I am a big fan of open science and reproducibility. I started the first [ReproducibiliTea journal club](https://reproducibilitea.org/) in Norway and I am currently a steering committee member at the the [Norwegian Reproducibility Network](https://norrn.no/).

But most excitingly, I just became a dad to a beautiful little baby girl:heart:
