  I'm currently a Post-Doctoral Fellow in Behavioral Economics at [JEDI lab](http://jedilab.weebly.com/) at Linköping University in Sweden :sweden: and an Associate Professor in Organizational Behavior at Oslo Business School (OsloMet) in Oslo, Norway :norway:.

  I completed my PhD in Leadership and Organisation at BI Norwegian Business School in 2023, supervised by Professor Thorvald Hærem and Associate Professor Erik Løhre. My dissertation examined the role of emotions and psychological distance in decision-making under risk and uncertainty. During my PhD, I was also a visiting scholar at New York University, with [Trope Lab](https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/tropelab//).

  My research covers different themes, but broadly, it centers on judgment and decision-making, focusing on how emotions and various cognitive and social psychological factors shape people´s decisions, particularly those made under risk and uncertainty. Much of my work is also focused on replicating (and extending) previous well-known findings.

  I am a big fan of open science and reproducibility. I started the first [ReproducibiliTea journal club](https://reproducibilitea.org/) in Norway and I am currently a steering committee member at the the [Norwegian Reproducibility Network](https://norrn.no/).

  More excitingly, I just became a dad to a beautiful little baby girl:heart:
