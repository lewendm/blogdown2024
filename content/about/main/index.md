  My research covers different themes, but broadly, it centers on judgment and decision-making, focusing on how emotions and various cognitive and social psychological factors shape peopleÂ´s decisions, particularly those made under risk and uncertainty. Much of my work is also focused on replication of previous well-established findings.
