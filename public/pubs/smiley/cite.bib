	abstract = {. We performed an independent, direct, and better powered 						(N = 295) replication of Study 1, an 					experiment (N = 113) by Lammers, Stoker, and Stapel (2009). Lammers and 					colleagues distinguished between social power (influence over others) and 					personal power (freedom from the influence of others), and found support for 					their predictions that the two forms of power produce opposite effects on 					stereotyping, but parallel effects on behavioral approach. Our results did not 					replicate the effects on behavioral approach, but partially replicated the 					effects on stereotyping. Compared to personal power, social power produced less 					stereotyping, but neither form of power differed significantly from the control 					condition, and effect sizes were considerably lower than the original estimates. 					Potential explanations are discussed.},
