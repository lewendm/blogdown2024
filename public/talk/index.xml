      <description>I was so excited to invite Gilad Feldman, Assistant Professor at Hong Kong University, for a hands-on workshop on replications at our department. For two intensive days, Gilad walked us through every key stage of conducting a replication. We targeted a classic study to replicate, dissected the target to figure out how to replicate it, preregistered analytical plan and hypotheses, collected data, and even ended up with a manuscript draft that we worked on together.</description>
